            </div>
            <div style="text-align: justify;padding-top: 6px;">
              <span class="aalokan-pg">Our Institute has an inspiring learning environment to all the RAS aspirants including one to one mentoring sessions on strategy building,effective time management and catching up with the current affairs. With emphasis on constant assessment in the form of weekly tests followed with in depth explanations and weekly Indian and Rajasthan current affairs class.</span><br> <br>
          </div>
          <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="aalokan-pg">We are proud of our guiding principles, which lead students to understand the basics and encourage them to question the facts / theories rather than just accepting them. Our effort is not only to provide them with a road-map to effective learning, but also to reassure them of our motivating concern during their journey on the road to success.</span>

          <h2>Our Idealogy</h2>
       </div>
       <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <span class="aalokan-pg">At Aalokan Academy, students are encouraged to develop a pattern that proves to be effective in the long run. In terms of learning, there is something new to discover and analyze each and every day. To know more about how we can help you inch closer to the dream of clearing RPSC & UPSC, get in touch with Aalokan Academy. The Academy affords a personal touch to all its students with small class sizes, quick student service and assistance in finding accommodation for students from outside.</span> <br><br>
       </div>
       <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <span class="aalokan-pg">Candidates appearing at this examination would be facing an examination which in many aspects differs from the university type exam. Consequently, the technique of preparation has to differ to suit the matrix of this examination. Preparation for most university examinations can be done at a leisure pace.</span><br><br>
     </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
       <span class="aalokan-pg">On the contrary, a candidate for the Civil & State Services Examination does not have much time at his disposal. It will be extremely unrealistic to think that one can prepare for this examination within a short time. Apart from vigorous preparation for at least one year, if candidates keep this examination in view for one more preceding year, they would be on the right path.</span><br><br>
      </div>
       <div style="text-align: justify;">
       <span class="aalokan-pg">The Academy emphasizes on the nature of the preparation to be made, the pattern of setting the questions and how to tackle them, evoking their interest in the various areas of knowledge, and acquiring a picture-like view of the various themes to be studied.</span><br><br>
        </div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <span class="aalokan-pg">All these dimensions of guidance would be PEDAGOGY projected as the teachers talk to the students in the sittings (no classes here) as per the schedule of work given to them at the time of enrolment. During the course duration the students will be spending on an average four hours every day in the Academy.</span><br><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <span class="aalokan-pg">During the initial stages of preparation, aspirants are not clear with what to read in a newspaper and what might be avoided. Aalokan Academy provides a list of all important headlines to be read daily which helps you maintain focus on only relevant portions of the newspaper. Take down notes of all that seems important. Notes will be of great help during the revision as it is difficult to go back to everything in detail at the last minute. When there is more clarity - make notes of very, very important topics - just to say that important notes of current affairs in a week should be good enough.</span> <br><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <span class="aalokan-pg">It would be a good idea to make notes of the editorial sections of the newspapers, while all other current affairs are already provided in the 'Aalokan' magazine. While the 'Focus' magazine provides notes on all the contemporary issues, reading newspapers helps in understanding the overall context of the issue being discussed. Thus, both go hand-in-hand. While the magazine is a collection of notes prepared by professional faculty, taking down notes from newspapers will give added advantage for the preparation.</span><br><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
          <span class="aalokan-pg">To help IAS RAS aspirants with newspaper reading, Aalokan Academy IAS makes YouTube Videos called "Daily News Simplified (DNS)" which guide students regarding what news and editorials to study, why to study as well as how to study them.</span>
